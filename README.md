 Work Day Scheduler

## The main objective was for app to do the following:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.


* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.


* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.


* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock


* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.


* Persist events between refreshes of a page
